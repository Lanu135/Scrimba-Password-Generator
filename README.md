# Scrimba-Password-Generator
<a target="_blank" href="https://scrimba.com/">Scrimba.com</a> Solo Project from Module #3 (Making websites interactive) of the Frontend Career Path

The requirments were the following

- build from scratch
- generate two random passwords when the user clicks the button
- each password shall be 15 chrackters long
  
Stretch goals:

- ability to set the password length
- add "copy on click" (not implemented yet
- toggles "symbols" and "numbers" on/off

Summary:

I used the darkmode Figma design. For me it was challeging to get the array back to "normal" after a checkbox was unchecked and checked again. 
Finally I figured out that I didn't used all if conditionals.
In that module I learned about loops and arrays, if statements, logical operators, objects and functions. So it was a nice practice to build this password generator,
to deepen the learned stuff :)

I will try to implement the "copy on click" feature.
